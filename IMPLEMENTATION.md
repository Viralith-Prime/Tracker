## Key Implementation Details

### Data Source Management
```javascript
// Resilient API architecture with automatic fallback
async fetchMilitaryAircraft() {
    const endpoints = this.getApiEndpoints();
    try {
        // Try primary source (adsb.fi or adsb.lol)
        const data = await this.fetchFromSource(endpoints[primarySource]);
        if (data && data.ac && data.ac.length > 0) {
            this.processMilitaryData(data, primarySource);
            return;
        }
    } catch (error) {
        // Automatic fallback to secondary source
        const data = await this.fetchFromSource(endpoints[fallbackSource]);
        this.processMilitaryData(data, fallbackSource);
    }
}
```

### Aircraft Enrichment Process
1. **Type Identification**: ICAO code to aircraft name mapping
2. **Category Assignment**: Military role classification
3. **Callsign Analysis**: Country and unit identification
4. **Intelligence Assessment**: Strategic significance evaluation
5. **Research Link Generation**: External OSINT database connections

### Map Visualization
- **Dark Theme**: Military-style dark map tiles
- **Custom Icons**: Category-specific aircraft symbols with colors
- **Interactive Popups**: Quick aircraft information display
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive interface for desktop/mobile

## OSINT Integration

### External Research Links
The system automatically generates research links for each aircraft:

| Source | Purpose | Example URL |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **ADS-B Exchange** | Unfiltered flight history | `globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao={hex}` |
| **FlightRadar24** | Commercial tracking data | `flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/{hex}` |
| **FAA Registry** | Aircraft registration | `registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/...` |
| **JetPhotos** | Aircraft photography | `jetphotos.com/registration/{nNumber}` |
| **PlaneSpotters** | Aircraft specifications | `planespotters.net/search?q={nNumber}` |

### Callsign Intelligence
The system recognizes military callsign patterns:
- **RCH**: US Air Force Reach (Transport)
- **POLO**: KC-135 Tanker operations
- **GRIM**: A-10 Attack aircraft
- **SPAR**: Special Air Mission (VIP)
- **AWACS**: NATO E-3 operations

## Understanding Military Transparency

### What You Will See
Based on the **doctrine of discretion**, visible aircraft include:

1. **Training Operations**: Aircraft in designated training areas
2. **Logistics Flights**: Transport and cargo operations
3. **Air Refueling**: Tanker aircraft in international airspace
4. **Surveillance Missions**: Maritime patrol and ISR operations
