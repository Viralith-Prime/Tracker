## Technical Architecture

This application implements **Blueprint A: The API-Centric Architecture** as recommended in the feasibility report:

### Data Sources
- **Primary**: adsb.fi public API (`https://opendata.adsb.fi/api/v2/mil`)
- **Fallback**: ADSB.lol public API (`https://api.adsb.lol/v2/mil`)
- **Rate Limits**: Respects 1 request/second for adsb.fi
- **Resilient Design**: Automatic fallback between data sources

### Key Technologies

- **Storage**: Local storage for settings persistence

## Installation and Usage

### Quick Start
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. The application will automatically connect to data sources and begin tracking

### No Dependencies Required
- No account registration needed
- No API keys required
- No server setup necessary
- Works entirely in the browser

### Browser Requirements
- Modern browser with ES6 support (Chrome 60+, Firefox 55+, Safari 12+)
- JavaScript enabled
- Internet connection for data fetching

## Understanding the Data

### What You Will See
Based on the principle of "transponder discipline," the aircraft visible on this tracker include:

- **Transport Aircraft**: C-130 Hercules, C-17 Globemaster III, A400M Atlas
- **Tanker Aircraft**: KC-135 Stratotanker, KC-10 Extender, A330 MRTT
- **Surveillance Aircraft**: P-8 Poseidon, E-3 AWACS, RC-135 Rivet Joint
- **Training Aircraft**: T-38 Talon, T-6 Texan II
- **VIP Transport**: Government and military executive aircraft
- **Some Fighter Aircraft**: During training or transit operations

### What You Will NOT See
- Combat aircraft on active missions
- Aircraft in hostile or contested airspace
- Special operations flights
- Aircraft deliberately operating "dark" for OPSEC reasons

### Intelligence Context
The visibility of military aircraft is **intentional**. Aircraft choose to broadcast their positions for:
- Legal compliance in civilian airspace
- Air traffic separation
- Power projection and deterrence
- Training and routine operations

## Features Overview

### Real-time Tracking
- Updates every 10 seconds (configurable)
- Automatic stale aircraft removal
- Live position updates with heading indication

### Aircraft Categories
- **Fighters** ‚úàÔ∏è: Combat and attack aircraft
- **Transports** üõ´: Cargo and personnel transport
- **Tankers** ‚õΩ: Aerial refueling aircraft
- **Surveillance** üì°: Intelligence and reconnaissance
- **Helicopters** üöÅ: Rotary-wing aircraft
- **Special Operations** ‚ö°: Specialized mission aircraft
- **VIP Transport** üëë: High-value personnel transport

### Intelligence Assessment
Each aircraft receives an automated intelligence assessment including:
- **Significance Rating**: 1-5 scale based on strategic importance
- **Mission Type Analysis**: Probable mission based on aircraft type and patterns
- **Operational Notes**: Contextual intelligence indicators

### OSINT Research Integration
Direct links to external research sources:
- **ADS-B Exchange**: Unfiltered flight history
- **FlightRadar24**: Commercial tracking data
- **FAA Registry**: Aircraft registration information
- **JetPhotos**: Aircraft photography database
- **PlaneSpotters**: Detailed aircraft specifications

## Settings and Customization

### Update Intervals
- 5, 10, 15, or 30-second refresh rates
- Automatic rate limiting compliance
- Background update management

### Data Source Selection
- Primary source selection (adsb.fi or ADSB.lol)
- Automatic fallback capability
- Source status indication

### Display Options
- Category filtering
- Map centering controls
- Future: Flight trail tracking
- Future: Label display options

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Public Data Sources
This application uses only **publicly broadcast** ADS-B signals aggregated by community-driven networks. All data is:
- Transmitted voluntarily by aircraft
- Aggregated by volunteer networks
- Available through public APIs
- Unencrypted and openly accessible

### OSINT Compliance
The system operates within the framework of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT):
- No classified information is accessed
- No systems are infiltrated or compromised
- All data sources are publicly available
- Research links connect to legitimate databases

### Responsible Use
Users should:
- Understand the voluntary nature of the data
- Respect operational security considerations
- Use information for educational purposes
- Avoid interfering with military operations

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Flight Trail Tracking**: Historical path visualization
- **Pattern Analysis**: Long-term operational pattern identification
- **Geographic Analysis**: Regional activity monitoring
- **Alert System**: Notification of significant aircraft appearances
- **Export Capabilities**: Data export for analysis

### Advanced OSINT Features
- **Historical Analysis**: Long-term pattern identification
- **Geographic Correlation**: Regional activity analysis
- **Unit Identification**: Enhanced military unit recognition
- **Mission Pattern Recognition**: Automated operational analysis

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Integration
```javascript
// Example API call to adsb.fi
const response = await fetch('https://opendata.adsb.fi/api/v2/mil');
const data = await response.json();
```

### Data Structure
Aircraft objects include:
- **hex**: ICAO 24-bit identifier
- **flight**: Callsign
- **lat/lon**: Position coordinates
- **alt_baro**: Barometric altitude
- **gs**: Ground speed
- **track**: Heading
- **t**: Aircraft type

### Enrichment Process
1. **Type Identification**: Aircraft type database lookup
2. **Category Assignment**: Fighter, transport, tanker, etc.
3. **Callsign Analysis**: Country and unit identification
4. **Intelligence Assessment**: Significance and mission analysis
5. **Research Link Generation**: External database connections

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **No aircraft visible**: Check internet connection and wait for data refresh
- **Map not loading**: Verify JavaScript is enabled
- **Settings not saving**: Check browser local storage permissions

### Data Source Issues
- **Connection failed**: Application will automatically try fallback source
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in delays prevent API overuse
- **No data returned**: May indicate low military activity in current timeframe

## Contributing

This project is designed as a complete, standalone implementation. Potential contributions:
- Additional aircraft type identification
- Enhanced callsign pattern recognition
- Improved intelligence assessment algorithms
- Additional OSINT data source integration

## License

This project is provided for educational and research purposes. Users are responsible for compliance with local laws and regulations regarding the use of publicly available aviation data.
